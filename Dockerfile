# Built from GoReleaser's prebuilt binaries (see .goreleaser.yaml's `builds`
# and `dockers_v2` sections) — this Dockerfile does NOT run `go build`, since
# that would compile the binary a second time, once per target platform, on
# top of GoReleaser already having done it. For a plain `docker build .`
# without GoReleaser (e.g. quick local testing), build the binary yourself
# first: CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o linux/amd64/propsy
# ./cmd/propsy, then `docker build --build-context .=.` from here — or just
# run `goreleaser release --snapshot --clean`, which does both steps for
# every supported platform.
